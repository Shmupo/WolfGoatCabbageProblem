# WolfGoatCabbageProblem
Apply AI search algorithms to solve the wolf goat cabbage problem.

Disclaimer: the search.py file was not made by me, only the wolfgoatcabbage.py is. I could not find where I got search.py from as I no longer take the course I needed it from, but it contains search algorithms.

To run, ensure you have python_utils installed. Place both py files in the same folder and run wolfgoatcabbage.py.
